# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS 

##  OBJECTIVE
EXTRACT INSIGHTS FROM THE TITANIC DATASET USING **VISUAL** AND **STATISTICAL** EXPLORATION TO IDENTIFY KEY TRENDS, RELATIONSHIPS, AND ANOMALIES THAT INFLUENCED PASSENGER SURVIVAL.

##  TOOLS & LIBRARIES USED
 **PYTHON** 
 **PANDAS** – DATA MANIPULATION AND CLEANING  
 **MATPLOTLIB** – DATA VISUALIZATION  
 **SEABORN** – ADVANCED VISUALIZATIONS  

##  DATASET
 **SOURCE:** [KAGGLE TITANIC DATASET](HTTPS://WWW.KAGGLE.COM/C/TITANIC/DATA)  
 **FILE USED:** `TITANIC.CSV`  
 **KEY COLUMNS:** PASSENGERID, SURVIVED, PCLASS, SEX, AGE, SIBSP, PARCH, FARE, EMBARKED

##  STEPS PERFORMED
### 1. DATA LOADING & EXPLORATION**
 LOADED DATASET USING PANDAS.
 CHECKED STRUCTURE USING:
  python
  DF.DESCRIBE()
  DF.INFO()
  DF.VALUE_COUNTS()
  IDENTIFIED MISSING VALUES AND PERFORMED BASIC CLEANING.
  
 ## 2. VISUALIZATIONS & OBSERVATIONS
 PAIRPLOT ANALYSIS
 OBSERVATION: SURVIVAL RATE VARIED WITH PCLASS, FARE, AND SEX. YOUNGER PASSENGERS AND HIGHER FARE PAYERS HAD BETTER SURVIVAL CHANCES.
 
 HEATMAP OF CORRELATIONS
 OBSERVATION: FARE HAD A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH SURVIVAL, WHILE PCLASS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED.
 
 SURVIVAL RATE BY GENDER
 OBSERVATION: FEMALES HAD A MUCH HIGHER SURVIVAL RATE COMPARED TO MALES, INDICATING "WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST" POLICY.
 
 SURVIVAL RATE BY PASSENGER CLASS
 OBSERVATION: FIRST-CLASS PASSENGERS HAD THE HIGHEST SURVIVAL RATE, SHOWING SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFLUENCE ON RESCUE PRIORITY.
 
 AGE DISTRIBUTION
 OBSERVATION: MOST PASSENGERS WERE BETWEEN 20–30 YEARS OLD. THERE WERE FEWER CHILDREN AND ELDERLY PASSENGERS.
 
 FARE DISTRIBUTION BY CLASS (BOXPLOT)
 OBSERVATION: FIRST-CLASS PASSENGERS PAID SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FARES, WITH SOME EXTREME OUTLIERS.
 
 AGE VS FARE VS SURVIVAL (SCATTERPLOT)
 OBSERVATION: HIGHER FARES AND CERTAIN AGE GROUPS (YOUNGER PASSENGERS) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SURVIVAL RATES.

 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
GENDER: FEMALES HAD A MUCH HIGHER SURVIVAL RATE THAN MALES.
CLASS: HIGHER-CLASS PASSENGERS HAD BETTER CHANCES OF SURVIVAL.
FARE: PASSENGERS WHO PAID HIGHER FARES TENDED TO SURVIVE MORE.
AGE: YOUNGER PASSENGERS HAD SLIGHTLY BETTER SURVIVAL RATES.
CORRELATION: FARE AND PCLASS WERE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NUMERICAL FACTORS.
POSSIBLE REASON: RESCUE EFFORTS PRIORITIZED WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND WEALTHIER PASSENGERS.
